<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Japan’s Fureai Kippu (‘Ticket for a Caring Relationship’) refers to mutual support networks of
members of all ages, targeted at providing care for older people through exchanges of time
credits, sometimes supplemented by cash payments (‘time-banking’). This has attracted increasing
attention as a potential contribution to the ‘Big Society’ with an ageing population.
However, despite its pioneering role and scale, relatively little is known about the details and
outcomes of Fureai Kippu, and meanwhile simplistic and optimistic generalisations predominate.
This article, using historical analysis and empirical evidence, seeks to address these gaps
by examining the origins of Fureai Kippu, its early expansion, post-2000 slowdown and responses.
It considers the practical contributions and varied benefits potentially offered by the
system, along with its operational difficulties. The conclusion is that Fureai Kippu is so complex
that not only is evaluation difficult but also no universal panacea can be expected from it.</p>

<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>One consequence of global ageing today is the increasing
demand for social care for growing numbers of frail older
people. This is particularly pertinent in Britain and Japan
where both governments are reviewing their social care
systems and seeking more cost-efficient and durable options,
given the shared challenging economic and demographic
circumstances and on-going social and cultural
transformations, particularly the decline in family care
capacity. In this context both governments have recently
emphasised voluntary over state initiatives in social issues,
including the care of older people, reflected in the ‘Big Society’
and ‘New Community’ concepts in Britain and Japan
respectively (Hayashi, 2010 <a class="citation-reference" href="#hayashi2010" id="citation-reference-1">[Hayashi2010]</a>). These call for a radical shift
in the relationship between citizens and the state and promoting
mutual help and popular participation, not least by
older people.</p>
<p>Against this background a renewed and growing attention
has been paid to one interesting Japanese innovation:
Fureai Kippu or time-banking. This involves mutual support
networks of members of all ages, targeted at providing
social care for frail older people through exchanges of time
credits, sometimes supplemented by cash payments. Politicians,
policy-makers and care experts in Britain enthusiastically
view Fureai Kippu as a potential model for the ‘Big
Society’ with a rapidly ageing population. For example, in
October 2010 Care Services Minister Paul Burstow hailed
on BBC the Japanese system as an ‘effective way’ to ‘enable
communities to take social care responsibilities on for
themselves’ (Quoted in BBC NEWS, 30.10.2010 <a class="citation-reference" href="#bbc2010" id="citation-reference-2">[BBC2010]</a>; The Independent,
30.10.2010). Recent initiatives in Britain
grounded in Fureai Kippu concepts include Care4Care (Isle
of Wight) and CareBank (the Big Society Vanguard Area,
Windsor and Maidenhead Council in Berkshire) (See respectively,
Care4Care website <a class="citation-reference" href="#care4care" id="citation-reference-3">[Care4Care]</a>, accessed 6.7.2012; CareBank
website <a class="citation-reference" href="#carebank2012" id="citation-reference-4">[CareBank2012]</a>, accessed 6.7.2012).</p>
<p>However, despite its pioneering role and large scale, we
still know remarkably little about the details and outcomes
of Fureai Kippu. This is, as discussed further below, due to
the dearth of published empirical and scholarly studies,
particularly outside Japan, and meanwhile, simplistic and
optimistic depictions, like those above, predominate, typically
reliant upon fragmentary or promotional material
written by advocates and proponents of Fureai Kippu or
time-banking.</p>
<p>This article, using historical analysis and empirical evidence,
seeks to address these gaps and deficiencies by exploring
critically and in detail the development of Fureai
Kippu from its origin in 1973 to the present. It examines its
evolution, longer-term trends, variations, operational details
and difficulties, and responses and challenges, particularly
the distinctive and predominant model of Fureai
Kippu which combines time credits and conventional
money, a post-2000 slowdown, recent remodelling and
new initiatives. It identifies and analyses the factors that
contributed to the 1990s expansion or the stagnation since
2000 to help inform successful and sustainable models,
while also acknowledging the complexity and demanding
nature of Fureai Kippu. It concludes by considering the
implications of time-banking to the area of care for frail
older people and assessing the role of Fureai Kippu in the
‘Big Society’ with a rapidly ageing population. Overall the
prime objective of the article is to examine Fureai Kippu in
its own right, acknowledging its specifics, diversity and
complexity in Japan’s cultural and policy contexts, rather
than shoe-horning it into existing time-banking ‘models’
based upon ideological or theoretical frameworks or analysing
it in a comparative or transnational context. It is
hoped that the findings arising from the article will offer
the foundations of a fuller and proper understanding of
Fureai Kippu.</p>
<p>The article begins with a brief review of the current research
on Fureai Kippu in and outside Japan to sort out
what we do know and what we do not about Fureai Kippu.
Providing some key representations and definitions of
Fureai Kippu, it identifies contributions, gaps and deficiencies
in current research, knowledge and understanding. It
then outlines the research methodology that informs the
empirical part of the article and highlights its significance
and contributions. An historical overview of Fureai Kippu
over the full near-40-year period is offered next. This section
examines in detail the evolution and development of
Fureai Kippu in the wider national contexts, highlighting its
significance and complexity, sensitive to the specific and
changing conditions of Japanese society. The following section,
mainly using empirical evidence and dealing with the
post-2000 period, explores persistent problems and responses
and challenges to these. In the conclusion, the article
revisits the key question - can Fureai Kippu be a potential
model for the ‘Big Society’ with a rapidly ageing population?</p>

<div class="section" id="research-on-fureai-kippu-current-knowledge-and-understanding">
<h1>RESEARCH ON FUREAI KIPPU: CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING</h1>
<p>Japan has been depicted as the country in the world with
the most complementary currency systems in operation,
but also the nation with the greatest diversity of such ex-
periments (Kennedy and Lietaer, 2004 <a class="citation-reference" href="#kennedy2004" id="citation-reference-5">[Kennedy2004]</a>). Between 2003 and
2011 alone, 662 complementary currency systems were
recorded across Japan (Tokutome website <a class="citation-reference" href="#tokutome2012" id="citation-reference-6">[Tokutome2012]</a>, accessed
6.7.2012). Less known, however, is the fact that many were
short-lived or temporary and, according to new estimates,
the actual number in operation has been much smaller -
just an estimated 197 in 2003 and 259 in 2008 - and has
actually stagnated or even been in decline in recent years,
although it still tops the world’s league table (Izumi,
3.4.2009a <a class="citation-reference" href="#izumi2009a" id="citation-reference-7">[Izumi2009a]</a>; Hirota, 2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#hirota2011" id="citation-reference-8">[Hirota2011]</a>). As for ‘the greatest diversity’, one
Japanese expert, Yasunori Hirota 廣田裕之 <a class="citation-reference" href="#hh" id="citation-reference-9">[HH]</a>, while agreeing literally,
argues that Japanese community currencies sometimes
have distinctive concepts and objectives, different from
their Western counterparts, so these might not be recognised
as such outside Japan, thereby calling into question
the clarity of ‘the greatest diversity’ (Hirota, 2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#hirota2011" id="citation-reference-10">[Hirota2011]</a>). This is
largely the case for Fureai Kippu or time-banking - one
major example of Japan’s complementary currency systems,
though relatively little is known.</p>

<!-- p.32 -->
<p>Belatedly, Fureai Kippu attained an international reputation
in 2001, when a promotional paper on time-banking
by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), introducer of
time banks to the UK, briefly referred it (NEF, 2001 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nef2001" id="citation-reference-11">[NEF2001]</a>) and
Bernard Lietaer, a Belgian expert on Japan’s complementary
currencies, praised it in his book: The Future of Money
as ‘A remarkably successful application of a specialized
“Healthcare Currency” operating at the national level in
Japan which ... has proved more cost effective and compassionate
than the system which prevails in the West’ (Lietaer 2001:188 <a class="citation-reference" href="#lietaer2001" id="citation-reference-12">[Lietaer2001]</a>, 202).
A decade later, Phillip Colligan of the
quango National Endowment for Science, Technology and
the Arts (NESTA) in London similarly provided positive
descriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
The Fureain Kippu schemes in Japan enable
people to earn credits for caring for elderly
people in their community. These credits
can then be used to ‘buy’ similar person to
person services by their relatives in another
part of the country, or even save them for
their own retirement. Developed over the
past 15 years, the use of this currency is now
nationwide, creating an alternative gift
economy of shared time, skills and resources
(Colligan, 2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#colligan2011" id="citation-reference-13">[Colligan2011]</a>).</blockquote>
<p>Such views are also shared by politicians and _ policymakers
in Britain, including Care Services Minister Paul
Burstow, noted above, Civil Society Minister Nick Hurd and
David Halpern, a member of Institute for Government and
advisor to Lord Nat Wei - the former government’s chief
advisor on the ‘Big Society’ (Halpern, 2010: 107 <a class="citation-reference" href="#halpern2010" id="citation-reference-14">[Halpern2010]</a>).</p>
<p>Back in Japan, the first research report on Fureai Kippu,
published in Japanese in 1992, defined it as:</p>
<blockquote>
A generic term for various time-based systems,
such as Time Deposit (Saving), Point
Deposit (Saving), Labour Bank, Time Stock
and Time Dollars etc. ... the members can
earn time credits or points for the hours
they volunteer, providing physical care,
home help and emotional assistance to the
care-dependent members. These credits can
then be registered by the host organisation
and saved in their personal accounts. Time
credits holders can withdraw and use their
credits to buy care for self or relatives as
required (SWF, 1993 <a class="citation-reference" href="#swf1993" id="citation-reference-15">[SWF1993]</a>).</blockquote>
<p>All these descriptions are useful but rather simplistic and
optimistic, overlooking variations among individual
schemes, arrangements between them, or problems and
challenges experienced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a number of more detailed studies have been
produced in and outside Japan. The most definitive synopsis
of Fureai Kippu to date remains Naoki Tanaka’s book (in
Japanese): Volunteering in Civil Society: Future for Fureai
Kippu (1996) <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-16">[Tanaka1996]</a>. This was supplemented and updated by the
non-profit Sawayaka Welfare Foundation’s compilation of
articles (2001) <a href="#system-message-1"><span class="problematic" id="citation-reference-17">[SWF2001]_</span></a>, with English translations, and other essays.
All of these were produced by proponents, focusing upon
theory and ideology, rather than actual practice. In contrast,
relevant, if less direct, texts and statistics have been
published in the areas of social policy, welfare for older
people and the voluntary sector. These are invaluable to
understand the wider background context of Fureai Kippu
development, since each is closely linked to the other. But
these were all written in Japanese and are available only
within Japan.</p>
<p>As for relevant English-language work, Elizabeth Miller’s
doctoral thesis on Japan’s time banks or Fureai Kippu, obtained
from an Australian university in 2008, examines
qualitative aspects- the impact of time banks on the lives of
older Japanese members - in the wider conceptual, policy
and transnational contexts, drawing on fieldwork study
and an extensive Japanese literature (Miller, 2008a <a class="citation-reference" href="#miller2008a" id="citation-reference-18">[Miller2008a]</a>). In
Britain David Boyle’s recent discussion paper: More Than
Money defines Fureai Kippu as ‘National insurance networks’
and depicts its predominant model, combining time
credits with conventional money, and other models which
privilege personal care effort over other forms of support
(Boyle, 2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#boyle2011" id="citation-reference-19">[Boyle2011]</a>). He also acknowledges one fundamental
problem: that service users are often unable to earn credits
because of their high disability/frailty and accordingly buy
services with money. Altogether, these more detailed
works have added new or critical insights to the current
widespread over-generalised and optimistic accounts.
Nonetheless, one major deficiency remains unresolved,
namely the dearth of quantitative data; although the information
on the number of Fureai Kippu branches every year
is available, there are no statistics on the actual number of
branches in operation, or on the total number of participants
or the hours logged or cleared (Lietar, 2004 <a class="citation-reference" href="#lietaer2004" id="citation-reference-20">[Lietaer2004]</a>). Worst
of all, there is hardly any research or data dealing with the
post-2000 period.</p>
<p>In short, although growing studies of Fureai Kippu in and
outside Japan have been produced since the late 1990s,
most of them lack historical or empirical analysis, with very
little material covering quantitative aspects or the post-2000
era. Moreover, they are predominantly written by
advocates and proponents of Fureai Kippu, time-banking or
complementary currency in general and, above all, are restricted
to specific countries and languages. Consequently,
what relevant literature exists remains rather limited and
simplistic and optimistic generalisations predominate. The
main aim of this article is therefore to address these gaps
and deficiencies by using untouched and new material and
by adopting a historical and empirical methodology, as
outlined next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="method-and-approach">
<h1>METHOD AND APPROACH</h1>
<p>The study adopts an evidence-based and rounded historical
approach, utilising wide-ranging materials, noted above.
This will enable the development of Fureai Kippu to be
contextualised socially, politically and culturally more
widely than has generally been the case in the past. Moreover
it employs an empirical method drawing from extensive
fieldwork studies involving interviews with a significant
number of subjects representing Fureai Kippu, exploring
members’ experiences, views and opinions. Supplementing
this were observations of member meetings and
activities at Fureai Kippu organisations visited. Finally a
large volume of evidence was derived from new and unpublished
printed matter produced by these organisations
during the course of the research. All those interviewed are
anonymised and quotes used in the article are cited, using
the first initial of the interviewee’s first name and surname,
followed by the date of the interview.</p>

<h1>HISTORICAL OVERVIEW, 1973-2012</h1>
<p>This section offers an historical overview of Fureai Kippu in
five phases, covering the full period from its origin in 1973
to the present. Acknowledging the changing and specific
conditions of Japanese society, it examines the evolution
and development of Fureai Kippu, asking how and why it
evolved and developed as it did, in such a way to deepen
understanding. It considers a longer-term trend, variations
and specific features, highlighting complexities and problems,
as explored in the next ‘Discussion’ section. The section
begins with an examination of the first Fureai Kippu,
Volunteer Labour Bank in 1973, then a brief survey of Japan’s
elderly care situation to understand the emergence in
the 1980s of mutual help groups where registered volunteers
provided social care for care-dependent older people
living at home, which is the theme of the third section. It
was these that introduced the predominant model of Fureai
Kippu which expanded considerably during the 1990s, as
considered in the fourth section. Finally the post-2000

<h2>Pioneer ‘Volunteer Labour Bank’ of 1973</h2>
<p>The world’s first time bank - Volunteer Labour Bank (hereafter
VLB) - was established in Osaka by Teruko Mizushima
in 1973. This has long been neglected despite its significance,
given its pioneering role and scale. Only recently did
this catch any international attention, precisely because of
that significance and also because it is similar to a leading
time-banking system devised in the 1980s by Dr Edgar
Cahn, a world-leading American proponent (Miller, 2008a <a class="citation-reference" href="#miller2008a" id="citation-reference-21">[Miller2008a]</a>,
2008b <a class="citation-reference" href="#miller2008b" id="citation-reference-22">[Miller2008b]</a>; Hirota, 2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#hirota2011" id="citation-reference-23">[Hirota2011]</a>). Nonetheless, relatively unknown is
the fact that VLB is not a representative of Fureai Kippu; it
is actually a minority model among Fureai Kippu schemes
and had been marginalised by the later 1990s when
schemes involving conventional money had grown rapidly
and predominated.</p>
<p>VLB is a membership voluntary group whose activities
included labour exchanges between the members through
a time-based complementary currency - Love Currency.
Whereas conventional money was subject to inflation and
the market economy, Mizushima emphasised: ‘There is no
inflation in our labour [outside the market] ... The interest
of our Bank is friendship’, targeting housewives and stayhome
mothers for membership and mutual volunteering as
self-enlightenment and improvement (Quoted in Tanaka,
1996:91 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-24">[Tanaka1996]</a>). Its establishment in 1973 coincided with an upsurge
in women’s group activities, which by the 1970s had
become a significant force in Japanese society. According to
Miller and others, although VLB was not directly linked
with the then emerging women’s liberation movement,
members did share a common goal with feminists of wanting
to improve the lives of women and so VLB had a revolutionary
potential to reverse the established value priorities
(Miller, 2008b <a class="citation-reference" href="#miller2008b" id="citation-reference-25">[Miller2008b]</a>). In other words, the prime motives and
aims of VLB were not directly related to the care of older
people, which was an emerging political and public concern
but had not yet become significant. This suggests the close
linkage of time-banking with national contexts, while simultaneously
highlighting also differences between VLB
which evolved in 1973 and the predominant model which
emerged in the 1980s. Yet a key component of VLB was
‘care’, which included the care of older people as well as of
other groups (Miller, 2008b <a class="citation-reference" href="#miller2008b" id="citation-reference-26">[Miller2008b]</a>).</p>
<p>Under the VLB system healthy members earn love currency
based upon the hours they assist needy currency-holder
members, who in turn pay for the help received with love
currencies saved in their personal accounts. Voluntary help
can be gained only through love currencies - not conventional
money - so the system is restricted to currency-holder
members and excludes those unable to earn currencies
themselves and those who have used up currencies
donated by headquarters or by currency-holder relatives.
Despite such restrictions, within the first six years VLB
became nationwide with 3,000 members and by 1992,
membership reached 4,000 in 326 branches across Japan
(Tanaka, 1996:92 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-27">[Tanaka1996]</a>). The small size of branches, averaging
twelve members per branch, was in accord with the early
directions of Mizushima, who believed that people function
most effectively in small groups and emphasised active
participation by all members who would contribute rather
than just follow what others did without thinking (Millar,
2008b <a class="citation-reference" href="#miller2008b" id="citation-reference-28">[Miller2008b]</a>).</p>
<p>The expansion might, in part, be the reflection of this
‘small’ model and also of limited employment opportunities
for Japanese women - particularly the middle-aged and
‘young old’. Yet following the death of founder and chair
Mizushima in 1996, the members involved in love
currency/time-banking activity contracted to just a few
hundred in thirty-six branches by 2003, with the total
1,234-hours love currencies being exchanged that year
among the members (VLB website, <a class="citation-reference" href="#vlb" id="citation-reference-29">[VLB]</a> accessed 6.7.2012). The
prime factor for this is undoubtedly the loss of Mizushima,
but perhaps equally important is the restriction of reciprocal
exchanges to currency-holder members: active volunteer
members might have no relatives requiring or wishing
for assistance, and others requiring support could not access
it once they lacked currencies because of their frailty.
A few similar small local schemes, including Time Dollar
Network Japan, developed since the 1980s but remain insignificant.</p>
<!-- p.34 -->
<p>In short, VLB and other similar schemes had become a minority
model within Fureai Kippu by the late 1990s. This
casts some doubt on the applicability of ‘person-to-person’
reciprocal exchanges through time credits only, where activities
are concentrated on care for care-dependent people,
discussed further in the ‘Discussion’ section below, as
is a recent remodelling seen in one VLB branch. Meanwhile,
the predominant model, involving conventional money,
evolved from the 1980s. As in VLB, its evolution was
closely linked with Japan’s changing and particular situation,
so a brief survey, in relation to the care of older people,
is provided first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background-japans-elderly-care-situation-in-the-1980s-90s">
<h2>Background: Japan’s elderly care situation in the 1980s-90s</h2>
<p>Japan belatedly earned the United Nations’ (hereafter UN)
definition of an ‘ageing society’ in 1970, with 7% of its total
population aged 65 or more. By 1994 Japan had become
the UN’s definition of an ‘aged society’ of 14% of its population
aged 65 or more (Cabinet Office, 2011). It was the
speed that made Japan distinctive: it has taken only 24
years for Japan to double its ageing rates from 7 to over
14%, compared with 115 years for France, 69 years for the
United States and 45 years in the UK and Spain (US Census
Bureau, 2009). Meanwhile, the capacity of families to provide
such care continued to decline, reflecting changes in
demographic and residence patterns, gender roles and
employment practices.</p>
<p>In this context demand for social care for growing numbers
of frail older people increased rapidly, but resources beyond
family care were extremely limited and too often not
accessible or acceptable. Statutory social care provision for
care-dependent older people was means-tested and severely
under-developed. Unsurprisingly only the very
worst-off older people living alone were helped. Private
arrangements were even more limited and too expensive
for the majority of older people in need and their families.
Voluntary initiatives were also limited; beyond informal
networks of friends and close neighbours, there were
hardly any non-profit organisations or voluntary or self-help
groups specifically providing support for needy older
people living at home. Nonetheless, Japan boasted specific
forms of ‘voluntary’ arrangements, which were comprehensive,
highly-organised and long-established because of
or, more precisely, thanks to the heavy central and local
government involvement. Enjoying stable public funding,
these were subject to government influence and attitudes
towards voluntary action which characterised an old style
of volunteering, embedded in Japanese cultural norms and
traditions (Adachi, 2000 <a class="citation-reference" href="#adachi2000" id="citation-reference-30">[Adachi2000]</a>; Nakajima, 2009 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nakajima2009" id="citation-reference-31">[Nakajima2009]</a>). It featured collective
‘Giving services for sorry people’ (Ho-shi), duty and
compassion, rather more spontaneous local or personalised
involvement, which in turn deterred contemporary
needy older people who associated the citizen-led voluntary
help with government-directed or top-down, stigmatised
relief (Adachi, 2008 <a class="citation-reference" href="#adachi2008" id="citation-reference-32">[Adachi2008]</a>; Nakajima, 2009 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nakajima2009" id="citation-reference-33">[Nakajima2009]</a>). While whether
the latter arrangements could be called ‘voluntary’ is debatable,
Japan’s domiciliary care provision outside the family -
whether public, private or voluntary - in the 1970s-90s
was limited in the face of dramatically increasing demand,
though an incremental expansion in statutory provision
had taken place (Maeda, 2000 <a class="citation-reference" href="#maeda2000" id="citation-reference-34">[Maeda2000]</a>).</p>
<p>The post-1973 Japan also experienced the economic slowdown
and high inflation following the oil crises. This led the
post-1979 governments to ‘Reconsider welfare’ and to
champion a ‘Japanese-style welfare state’ and ‘Vibrant welfare
society’, emphasising cultural norms and traditions of
mutual help networks among families and neighbours (Lee,
1987 <a class="citation-reference" href="#lee1987" id="citation-reference-35">[Lee1987]</a>; Mori, 2008 <a class="citation-reference" href="#mori2008" id="citation-reference-36">[Mori2008]</a>). The government emphasised public
participation and active volunteering, creating a vision of
‘Public participant-style welfare Jumin sanka-gata fukushi’
(Yoshimura, 1993 <a class="citation-reference" href="#yoshimura1993" id="citation-reference-37">[Yoshimura1993]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="emergence-of-mutual-help-groups-in-the-1980s-prelude-to-fureai-kippu-predominant-model">
<h2>Emergence of mutual help groups in the 1980s: Prelude to Fureai Kippu predominant model</h2>
<p>Against this specific national background, the 1980s witnessed
the emergence of grassroots mutual help groups in
metropolitan and urban areas where the limitations of family
care were most exposed, with 138 such groups in 1987
and 1,183 by 1997 (National Welfare Council, 2008 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nwc2008" id="citation-reference-38">[NWC2008]</a>). They
operated on a membership basis, with registered volunteers
and service users, the latter predominantly older
people living alone or left by their family members. In 1996
some 70,000 volunteers in such groups provided four million
hours of personal assistance and 1.8 million meals to
54,000 frail older members (MoHW, 1995 <a class="citation-reference" href="#mohw1995" id="citation-reference-39">[MoHW1995]</a>). This represented
a considerable effort but one to be set against the
220,000 statutory domiciliary care service recipients and
an estimated 2.5 million frail older people seeking such
services but unable to access to them (MoHW, 1999 <a class="citation-reference" href="#mohw1995" id="citation-reference-40">[MoHW1995]</a>). The
vast majority of volunteers were middle-aged housewives
(Adachi, 2000 <a class="citation-reference" href="#adachi2000" id="citation-reference-41">[Adachi2000]</a>). Elderly care was their prime concern,
whether for family carers struggling to cope, or for isolated
care-dependent older people lacking any support, or for the
care prospects of themselves or their families (Kobayashi,
1994 <a class="citation-reference" href="#kobayashi1994" id="citation-reference-42">[Kobayashi1994]</a>: Morioka, 1998 <a class="citation-reference" href="#morioka1998" id="citation-reference-43">[Morioka1998]</a>).</p>
<p>Such mutual help groups initially arranged ‘pure’ voluntary
activities, in that registered volunteer members provided
care and support free of charge to registered care-dependent
elderly or disabled members. But totally unremunerated
volunteering did not work and so did not last
long (Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-44">[Tanaka1996]</a>). To answer why requires an understanding
of specific national contexts. First of all, reciprocity
is an essential feature within Japanese culture - favours
must be reciprocated - so older people embarrassed about
receiving service for nothing sought to pay back volunteers
(Akiyama et al, 1990). The second point was related to Japan’s
specific voluntary sector conditions at that time,
noted above, featuring under-developed citizen-led voluntary
initiatives and the predominance of more comprehensive
‘voluntary’ networks with strong government involvement.
In this context, elderly members often confused
new citizen-led voluntary action with older forms, linking it
with traditional ones and associating both with a charity in
paternalism, stigma and shame. Both features produced
considerable resistance among elderly members to voluntary
help (Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-45">[Tanaka1996]</a>). The third feature was the need
for running expenses to ensure the stability and sustainability
of voluntary services. Since many grassroots mutual
help groups were new, small and above all, independent
from government, the need for expenses, such as travel
fares, communications, stationery, office hire and staff coordinator(s)’
labour, could divert volunteers’ time and efforts
to fund-raising, rather than direct services to older
members in need (Tanaka, 1996). Finally, group leaders
often felt it useful, desirable or even necessary to ‘reward’
volunteers, partly to attract wider recruits or to retain existing
volunteers. For example, some differentiated volunteers
engaged in very demanding, continuing and personalised
work from others involved in irregular or one-off
fund-raising or group activities (Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-46">[Tanaka1996]</a>).</p>
<!-- p.35 -->
<p>Accordingly the mutual help groups broke further from
traditions in charging small fees to service user members
and offering volunteer members small monetary remuneration
for their work. This distinctive form of volunteering
was paradoxically termed ‘paid volunteering’, which
indicated its ambiguous position (Yamashita, 2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#yamashita2011" id="citation-reference-47">[Yamashita2011]</a>). Members
providing care to needy members and receiving
monetary remuneration for their work were not considered
as paid staff, their financial reward being seen as a
token expressing ‘gratitude’, not a salary. Their work was
not considered as labour in the market or an occupation,
but ‘paid volunteering’. So this work was not regulated and
the token payment was often set out below the national
minimum wage of local part-time workers (excluding handling
fees) and was not linked to skill or expertise, although
some organisations might offer less for home help than for
physical nursing, or provide extra rewards for volunteering
in anti-social hours.</p>
<p>Yet such services were not ‘pure’ voluntary activities, since
providers received monetary reward for their ‘voluntary’
work. This specific ‘paid volunteering’ raised heated debates
and typically scholars and commentators argued
strongly that any voluntary work involving money -
whether charges to users or payments to volunteers - cannot
be called voluntary, since on first principles such work
should be free (Tanaka, 1996:130). Yet, as discussed, Japan
historically lacked concepts of non-profit voluntary organisations
beyond free provision of quasi-government ‘voluntary’
services and ‘informal’ support from family and
neighbours. It was only in 1998 that the enactment of the
Special Non-profit Activities Act made it easier for voluntary
organisations to gain legal recognition and provide
non-profit (pay) voluntary services by paid staff (Coulmas,
2007). Under such circumstances, ‘paid’ volunteering was
officially acknowledged as a form of volunteering (MoHW,
14.4.1993; MoHW, 29.7.1993 <a class="citation-reference" href="#mohw1993" id="citation-reference-48">[MoHW1993]</a>). By then the mutual help
groups adopting paid volunteering and focusing on providing
domiciliary care (mainly for older people) had also
been officially recognised as ‘Public participant-style domiciliary
care providing organisations’ emphasising the ‘mutual
ethos’ within the government ‘public participant-style
welfare’ concept, noted above (National Welfare Council,
2008). This is important because the predominant Fureai
Kippu model, discussed below, evolved from such mutual
help groups adopting paid volunteering and targeted at
providing domiciliary care for older people.</p>
<p>What were the effects of the new ‘paid volunteering’ arrangement
on these mutual help groups and their members?
User fees removed or reduced feelings of shame or
dependency among older beneficiaries, and freed them
from the psychological stress of obligations or owing. They
seemingly placed users and volunteer members on an
equal level. Similarly modest handling costs, often included
within user fees, assisted the viability of under-funded
groups and activities (Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-49">[Tanaka1996]</a>; SWF, 2000 <a class="citation-reference" href="#swf2000" id="citation-reference-50">[SWF2000]</a>). However,
monetary remuneration to volunteer members was more
problematic, since their prime motive or concern was typically
to help older people in need, not to receive financial
reward. Many increasingly viewed monetary remuneration
as inappropriate, whilst others regretted distant or
business-like responses from service users who regarded
‘paid’ volunteers as paid staff employed by for-profit companies,
sometimes expecting specialised services or demanding
too much. Thus volunteers felt their genuine efforts
were not recognised or were even exploited and their
personal relationships with users were damaged (Kobayashi,
1994 <a class="citation-reference" href="#kobayashi1994" id="citation-reference-51">[Kobayashi1994]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="expansion-of-the-predominant-model-in-the-1990s">
<h2>Expansion of the predominant model in the 1990s</h2>
<p>In responding to these last problems, some of these mutual
help groups, adopting ‘paid volunteering’ and involving
‘paid volunteer’ members and user fees to elderly members,
introduced a new reimbursement arrangement to
their paid volunteer members, combining monetary remuneration
with time credits: the members were given the
reimbursement option of conventional money or time credits
or both (Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-52">[Tanaka1996]</a>). This is how the distinctive and
soon predominant model of Fureai Kippu evolved within
these specific mutual help groups. This differed from other
time banks worldwide where members providing services
did not have an option to receive the monetary remuneration
for their services, instead of time credits.</p>
<p>This Fureai Kippu model addressed or mediated these
above-mentioned problems, offering volunteer members
the choice of time credits in lieu of or as part of cash payments,
thereby acknowledging altruistic motives and harmonising
volunteer-user relationships. Pioneers included
urban grassroots mutual help groups; the Help of Daily
Living Association in Tokyo (1981) and the Kobe Life Care
Association near Osaka (1982) whose registered members
provided small fee ‘voluntary’ services to care-dependent
older members and in return were rewarded with a mix of
time credits and cash payments under their own convertibility
rules (Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-53">[Tanaka1996]</a>; Miller, 2008a <a class="citation-reference" href="#miller2008a" id="citation-reference-54">[Miller2008a]</a>). Both organisations
still emphasised ‘equal mutuality’ and, as existing and
new mutual help groups followed suit, this specific model
involving conventional money became predominant within
Fureai Kippu schemes by the early 1990s (Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-55">[Tanaka1996]</a>).
By then the generic term, Fureai Kippu (‘Ticket for a Caring
Relationship’) had been coined by Mr Tsutomu Hotta, a
former Attorney General and Minister of Justice. He was
also the founder and chair of the non-profit Sawayaka Welfare
Foundation which, similar to Time Banks UK, was like
an umbrella body of local Fureai Kippu schemes across the
country, spreading best practice and providing assistance
(SWF website, <a class="citation-reference" href="#swf2012" id="citation-reference-56">[SWF2012]</a> accessed 6.7.2012). The intention of creating
the ‘generic’ term was to promote and enhance Fureai
Kippu and the collaboration between individual schemes.
Interestingly, although the term has been in use since 1992,
this is now largely unknown within Japan, in contrast to its
increasing recognition outside Japan. This partly reflects
the strong independent ethos of individual Fureai Kippu
groups which all have distinctive names (See Izumi,
3.4.2009b <a class="citation-reference" href="#izumi2009b" id="citation-reference-57">[Izumi2009b]</a>). This in turn explains slow or little progress
with coordination between individual schemes and plans
for the creation of a national clearing house.</p>
<!-- p.36 -->
<p>Between 1992 and 1998, the number of Fureai Kippu operating
branches/centres rose from 113 to 302 (Lietaer,
2004 <a class="citation-reference" href="#lietaer2004" id="citation-reference-58">[Lietaer2004]</a>). Of the 243 centres in 1996, 119 (49%) were run by
local government or quasi-government local welfare councils
(through newly-established welfare-led public corporations
Fukushi-kosha) or local welfare-led cooperatives,
with the remaining 124 (51%) by grassroots or voluntary
mutual help groups (Tanaka, 1996:107 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-59">[Tanaka1996]</a>). The former types
were larger involving several hundred participants, aided
by skilled paid staff, specialised administration and subsidies
from central and/or local government or cooperatives.</p>
<p>Thus both central and local government had an important
role in Fureai Kippu’s expansion. Fureai Kippu was well
suited to the post-1979 government policy focus on public
participation and active volunteering, which included
Fureai Kippu and mutual help groups within the vision of
‘public participatory-type welfare’, noting how their care
services for growing numbers of frail older populations at
home were supplementing or even replacing inadequate
statutory care arrangements (MoHW, 1995 <a class="citation-reference" href="#mohw1995" id="citation-reference-60">[MoHW1995]</a>). As early as
1980 the Tokyo Cosmopolitan Council had considered a
time bank as a new form of voluntary action, featuring reciprocal
exchanges and ‘volunteering with rewards’ (Cited
in Tanaka, 1996:103-4 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-61">[Tanaka1996]</a>). Yet critics argued that the government
essentially looked to cost-cutting measures,
maximising cheap volunteer labour, rather than opportunities
to create a civil society or boost public participation, in
encouraging local authorities and quasi-government local
welfare councils to establish welfare-led public corporations,
whose activities resembled those of mutual help
groups and 45% of them employed the Fureai Kippu system
in 1996 (Takano, 1993 <a class="citation-reference" href="#takano1993" id="citation-reference-62">[Takano1993]</a>; Tanaka, 1996:197 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-63">[Tanaka1996]</a>).</p>

<div class="section" id="post-2000-slowdown-impact-of-the-long-term-care-insurance-act-of-2000">
<h2>Post-2000 slowdown: Impact of the Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 2000</h2>
<p>The expansion of Fureai Kippu was limited by 2000, despite
growing demand arising partly from further population
ageing and the continued decline in family care capacity.
The post-2000 slowdown is also closely linked with
Japan’s changing situation, noticeably the implementation
of a major national social care reform in 2000 through its
Long-Term Care Insurance (hereafter LTCI) Act of 1997.
In brief, LTCI is a compulsory insurance-based national
social care system, featuring mandatory contributions from
everyone aged 40 or more, uniform entitlements to all
over-65s certified as eligible, and elements of consumer
choice in accessing LTCI care services. This arguably
marked a decisive shift away from the predominance of
family care towards a greater welfare mix in care delivery,
achieving the commodification and wider socialisation of
care (Izuhara, 2003 <a class="citation-reference" href="#izuhara2003" id="citation-reference-64">[Izuhara2003]</a>). LTCI statutory care provision grew
dramatically, with the number of older recipients of
community-based services (e.g. home help, personal care
and nurse visiting) increasing from 970,000 in 2000 to 2.51
million by 2005 (MoHWL, 2006 <a class="citation-reference" href="#mohlw2006" id="citation-reference-65">[MoHLW2006]</a>). But it resulted in a decline
in Fureai Kippu users, many of whom now qualified
for LTCI services with only 10% user fees (£1.7 for 1-hour
home help and £3.2 for 1-hour personal care [based on
£1=125yen]), much cheaper than average Fureai Kippu
charges (£6-8 for any help) (SWF, 2000:70 <a class="citation-reference" href="#swf2000" id="citation-reference-66">[SWF2000]</a>; Hayashi,
2011b <a class="citation-reference" href="#hayashi2011b" id="citation-reference-67">[Hayashi2011b]</a>). This had a considerable impact for the majority of
Fureai Kippu service users who were modest pensioners
and used to pay in cash due to their lack of time credits
(A.S. interview, 14.7.2011) Thus from the user’s perspective
the care provider did not matter much so long as the
services were affordable, reliable and not stigmatised. LTCI
services may also have been seen as more reliable.
Some Fureai Kippu organisations started to provide LTCI
statutory services as well as or instead of voluntary services
to boost service users and income. Members unhappy
about this sometimes left and others, with home help or
nurse qualifications, often took higher salaries for identical
work with commercial firms or in order to be recognised as
‘more professional’ (H.M. interview, 14.7.2011). Yet most
Fureai Kippu active members remained, as their prime
motive was to help others in need, so the supply side was
not particularly affected. Meanwhile, opportunities for volunteering
grew rapidly following the 1998 Special Nonprofit
Activities Act, which boosted the numbers and variety
of non-profit organisations (Kingston, 2004 <a class="citation-reference" href="#kingston2004" id="citation-reference-68">[Kingston2004]</a>). Unfortunately
the totals of Fureai Kippu volunteers or of schemes
being closed or amended are unknown, although the 1998
Act had an insignificant impact on Fureai Kippu expansion,
as its stagnation by 2000 demonstrated.</p>
<p>Yet skyrocketing LTCI expenditure and funding costs became
increasingly alarming, leading to revisions in 2005
which included stricter rationing, tightened eligibility criteria
and top-up user fees. LTCI home help services are now
restricted to older people living alone and with severe disabilities.
So, although almost five million older people (16%
of all over-65s) were eligible for LTCI care services in 2009,
nearly one million used no services whatsoever and the
three million choosing community-based care services
actually took up less than half of their full entitlement, reflecting
their financial difficulties and lack of available and/
or suitable services (Hayashi, 2011a <a class="citation-reference" href="#hayashi2011a" id="citation-reference-69">[Hayashi2011a]</a>). Consequently, demand
for Fureai Kippu has revived, witnessed by a rise in
the number of frail elderly members essentially using services
only in existing Fureai Kippu organisations. Yet active
members, who provide services for such frail members,
have not increased to keep pace with the rising demand
and even in decline, a theme explored in the ‘Discussion’
section.</p>
<!-- p.37 -->
<p>New 2012 unpublished estimates suggest 391 operating
branches/centres of Fureai Kippu across Japan (SWF,
20.1.2012 <a class="citation-reference" href="#swf2012" id="citation-reference-70">[SWF2012]</a>). Of the 391, 148 (38%) are run by small grassroots
groups and are largely new, local and independent. A
further 84 (21%) are run by local government or quasigovernment
bodies which are larger and date back to the
late 1980s and 1990s. The remaining 159 (41%) branches
are run by two non-profit organisations with wider networks
- 26 in Magokoro Care Services and 133 in Nippon
Active Life Club - which allow time credits to be transferred
within their own branches, a feature found only in Japan,
discussed further below. Yet there are no credit transaction
arrangements between the two organisations, partly reflecting
resistance to independent schemes in general. Thus
plans to establish a national clearing house, issuing comprehensive
time credits, transferable between all the
Fureai Kippu organisations, have still not materialised yet.</p>
<p>However, the 391 figures may be an overestimate since
some branches may not be active, and their operational
details, as regards participants or time involved, are not
available. Further new unpublished data provides actual
numbers of Fureai Kippu schemes/organisations (not
branches/centres) in operation during 2002-8; 132 in
2005 and 95 in 2008, for example (Izumi, 3.4.2009a <a class="citation-reference" href="#izumi2009a" id="citation-reference-71">[Izumi2009a]</a>). Of the
95 organisations in 2008, 82 were run by non-profit or
voluntary bodies, with just three by local government or
quasi-government bodies and the remaining ten unknown.
This suggests a much smaller scale than the 391 estimates
and little government involvement, compared to over a
hundred such in the late 1990s hey-days. In a comparative
context, the share of Fureai Kippu branches/centres to
mutual help groups providing similar services dropped
from one-third in 1996 to less than one-fifth by 2001 and
declining incrementally ever since (Tanaka, 1996:107 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-72">[Tanaka1996]</a>; National
Welfare Council, 2009 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nwc2009" id="citation-reference-73">[NWC2009]</a>).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Fureai Kippu had other positive impacts, seen
also in existing time bank studies elsewhere (Seyfang,
2004 <a class="citation-reference" href="#seyfang2004" id="citation-reference-74">[Seyfang2004]</a>; Collom, 2007 <a class="citation-reference" href="#collom2007" id="citation-reference-75">[Collom2007]</a>; Ozanne, 2010 <a class="citation-reference" href="#ozanne2010" id="citation-reference-76">[Ozanne2010]</a>). These include building
personal relationships and social connections; improving
the mental and physical health of participants; promoting
mutuality and responsibilities surrounding the care of vulnerable
people; and helping to create a more equal relationship
between volunteers and recipients. All of this was
expressed by the interviewees in the study, who were involved
in Fureai Kippu at policy, managerial or practical
levels (e.g. K.T. interview, 8.12.2010; A.S. interview,
14.7.2011). In the wider context of elderly care, Fureai
Kippu services supplement other care resources and they
are more cost-effective, flexible and humane than expensive,
‘top-down’, regulated and professionalised state care
provision. Not least, it represented the first ‘bottom-up’
civil action to address local social problems, pushing the
government finally to take greater responsibility for the
care of older people, notably the enactment of the LTCI
national social care reform in 2000.</p>

<h1>DISCUSSION: THE COMPLEXITY, PROBLEMS, NEW TRENDS AND CHALLENGES</h1>
<p>The post-2000 slowdown also reflected the complexity of
Fureai Kippu itself. This section, using mainly empirical
evidence drawing from the fieldwork study, seeks to elucidate
this complexity, exploring operational details, persistent
problems, consequences and responses. It identifies
and analyses the factors that contributed to or hindered the
expansion to help inform successful and sustainable models.
Finally it explores issues and challenges surrounding
Fureai Kippu and its operations.</p>
<div class="section" id="two-models-of-fureai-kippu">
<h2>Two models of Fureai Kippu</h2>
<p>Given Fureai Kippu’s generic label but various forms, discussion
here is based upon two models. The first features a
simple, traditional reciprocal exchanges system involving
time credits only and centred on ‘person-to-person’ activity,
including Volunteer Labour Bank (VLB) of 1973, which
is similar to the world-known Dr Edgar Cahn’s timebanking
system, but actually comprises the minority
among Fureai Kippu schemes. The other utilises conventional
money, relatively unknown in worldwide time banks
but always predominant in Japan, whereby service users
lacking time credits pay small user fees for the services.
How these fees are handled differs, with three main types
(SWF, 2000:10 <a class="citation-reference" href="#swf2000" id="citation-reference-77">[SWF2000]</a>; Hayashi, 2011b <a class="citation-reference" href="#hayashi2011b" id="citation-reference-78">[Hayashi2011b]</a>).</p>
<p>A. In the 100% organisation saving type, small user
fees are paid to the organisation, not to individual
volunteers. These are treated as near-mandatory
donations, covering handling/organisational costs,
and belong to the organisation. All hours spent by
volunteers helping fee-paying users are registered
and saved as time credits, but there is no cash exchange
between volunteers and users. This is a minority
form, though Japanese experts and scholars
regard it as ‘the model’ Fureai Kippu</p>
<p>B. The options system type features an optional cash
exchange between fee-paying users and volunteers.
Users pay fees for volunteer services but the latter
have the option to choose whether to deposit their
volunteering hours as time credits or receive cash
payments. Arrangements may be finessed, with
certain thresholds or maximums concerning time
credits, but there is normally a cash option.</p>
<p>C. In the quota system type, a quota acts as incentive/
regulation for volunteers to bank a certain amount
of volunteering hours, the rest being received in
cash automatically.</p>
<!-- p.38 -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="debates-on-guarantees-over-time-credits">
<h2>Debates on guarantees over time credits</h2>
<p>Whichever the model or type, there were growing concerns
over guarantees for time credits; essentially, how to promise
time credit holders the future Fureai Kippu care provision
for themselves or relatives equivalent to their time
credits saved (SWF, 2000:9). This has been documented
elsewhere (Boyle, 2000), but was particularly significant in
Japan and partly reflected its specific voluntary sector
situation, noted above: because Japan’s voluntary sector
was dominated by traditional quasi-government bodies
supported by stable public funding, Japanese people duly
expected any risks under Fureai Kippu groups to be safeguarded
or compensated by government or through public
money. In contrast, outside Japan many small voluntary
groups have closed and thus expectations about voluntary
bodies are generally lower.</p>
<p>In response, many organisations introduced an exchange
rate to convert hourly-based time credits into conventional
money and guaranteed to pay back in cash equivalents, if
requested. Yet the ethos of Fureai Kippu is that credits are
paid back in the form of time. The key promoter Tsutomu
Hotta likens its mutual support to that between parents
and children, beyond the Law of Obligations or Labour
Standards Law: Fureai Kippu is not legal tender, nor a
means for accumulating wealth as it operates outside the
market economy (SWF, 2000:21 <a class="citation-reference" href="#swf2000" id="citation-reference-79">[SWF2000]</a>). He argues that time credits
should not have a monetary value but the rationale is
that: ‘the system will make every effort to guarantee services
as long as the members can respond to the needs’
(SWF, 2000:9 <a class="citation-reference" href="#swf2000" id="citation-reference-80">[SWF2000]</a>).</p>
<p>Such a definition has gained a growing consensus among
experts, promoters and practitioners of Fureai Kippu, including
Keiichi Takahata of Nippon Active Life Club (hereafter
NALC). Takahata reiterates that ‘time credits must not
link with conventional money. I’ve seen many organisations,
adopting a money-convertible policy, go bankrupt
because of the shortage of pooled cash or confronted with
the threat of legal action’ (K.T. interviews, 8.12.2010 and
17.3.2012). By avoiding any demand for money from credit
holders, NALC has enjoyed a better financial position. This
also addresses the key concept of time bank - reciprocal
exchanges through time credits or time-based activities,
not conventional money.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discussions-on-cash-rewards-types-b-and-c">
<h2>Discussions on ‘cash’ rewards (Types B and C)</h2>
<p>While the consensus on no monetary value for time credits
and hence no compatibility of credits with money was
widely attained, there were also heated debates over the
monetary remuneration paid to volunteer members in
Fureai Kippu Type B or C schemes, along with time credits
(Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-81">[Tanaka1996]</a>; K.T. interview, 8.12.2010). Although such
practice was officially acknowledged as ‘paid volunteering’
by ‘paid volunteers’ in mutual help groups, discussed
above, this was less so in Fureai Kippu circles, probably
partly attributable to the combination of rewards in kind
(time credits) and in cash (monetary remuneration), compared
to only cash rewards (in the mutual help groups) or
only time credits (in the Fureai Kippu Type A schemes)
(H.M. interview, 14.7.2011). Subsequently some Type B/C
organisations switched to mutual help groups, while others
reorientated to Type A or ‘100% organisation saving type’,
which accounted for over two-thirds of the total Fureai
Kippu schemes by 2008 (Izumi, 3.4.2009a <a class="citation-reference" href="#izumi2009a" id="citation-reference-82">[Izumi2009a]</a>). This growing
popularity reflects not only the key principle of timebanking
but also the healthier finance of organisations,
since user fees go wholly into the organisation, instead of
being paid to individual volunteer members.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issues-over-reciprocal-exchange-mechanisms-snapshot-of-nalc">
<h2>Issues over reciprocal exchange mechanisms: Snapshot of NALC</h2>
<p>Persistent problems and consequences experienced in
Fureai Kippu’s predominant model, involving user fees, are
exemplified by the snapshot of reciprocal exchange mechanisms
in Japan’s largest Fureai Kippu operating organisation,
the non-profit Nippon Active Life Club (NALC) (Figure
1), established in 1994 in Osaka by Keiich Takahata, a former
Panasonic executive and labour union leader. NALC
membership currently totals over 30,000 members in 133
branches nationwide, with two international partners with
a combined 200 members (NALC website, accessed
6.7.2012 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nalc2012" id="citation-reference-83">[NALC2012]</a>; NALC, 29.12.2010 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nalc201012" id="citation-reference-84">[NALC201012]</a>). During 2010, a total of
12,367 members assisted 3,126 members directly or indirectly,
earning 198,091 credits in total, while only 10,548
credits (5%) were redeemed, with the balance met by £4
per hour user fees (108,624 credits) or by the headquarters
(78,919). The latter involved non person-to-person
activities or office-based work (e.g. record keeping, coordinating
and training). Meanwhile a total of nearly 1.7 million
credits have been accumulated in individual members’
accounts.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="figure1.jpg" src="figure1.jpg" style="width: 541.5px; height: 368.5px;" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: NAIC annaul transactions (2010)</p>
<div class="legend">
Source: NALC (29.12.2010) Information supplied by email (in Japanese).</div>
</div>
<p>Evidently imbalances between issuing and redeeming credits
are unresolved and user fees remain critical in addressing
these. In other words, user fees help to guarantee or
generate ‘earning’ opportunities for active members
(whose main reason for being involved is the desire to help
others in need), while allowing existing and potential care-dependent
members lacking credits to access services by
paying with cash, instead of credits. Yet user fees do little to
generate matching ‘using’ opportunities to these active
members because reciprocal exchange mechanisms in
Fureai Kippu typically restrict earned credits that can be
used later in life or for relatives living elsewhere. According
to a comprehensive survey in 1996 less than 5% of the
total credits accumulated have been redeemed (Tanaka,
1996:169 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-85">[Tanaka1996]</a>). Similarly, at NALC a mere 0.6% (10,548) of the
banked credits (1,678,210) were redeemed in 2010 (Figure
1).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-trends-a-renewed-focus-on-horizontal-and-credit-to-credit-exchanges">
<h2>New trends: A renewed focus on ‘horizontal’ and ‘credit-to-credit’ exchanges</h2>
<p>While user fees continue in most Fureai Kippu schemes,
efforts and new initiatives have been made to supplement
or extend prescribed reciprocal exchange activities - providing
care of self in old age or care for relatives living
elsewhere. Accordingly, renewed attention has been paid
to boost the ‘horizontal’ use of earned credits for currently
active credit-holder members through new or enhanced
‘using’ opportunities. Before the discussion, a brief explanation
of the ‘horizontal’ use of earned credits can be offered.
The non-profit Sawayaka Welfare Foundation, the
founder and key promoter of Fureai Kippu, defines two
Fureai Kippu forms according to the time span between
earning and redeeming credits by credit-holder members
(Hotta, 2006). One is a banking time or ‘vertical’ type, featuring
earned credits being used over the life course, such
as in old age or in an emergency, and the other is a so-called
time-based currency or ‘horizontal’ type, featuring
earned credits being used within a short period of time,
including the existing limited credit transfers from volunteer
members to their frail elderly parents living elsewhere.
With the help of the Foundation, a total of 37 new
local Fureai Kippu schemes focusing on the ‘horizontal’ use
have been created between 2003 and 2005 (Hotta, 2006 <a class="citation-reference" href="#hotta2006" id="citation-reference-86">[Hotta2006]</a>).
Meanwhile attention has also been paid to boost ‘credit-to-credit’
transactions, rather than the predominant ‘cash-to-credit’
ones involving user fees. The following discusses
some attempts and new initiatives to boost the ‘horizontal’
use of earned credits, followed by those to enhance ‘credit-to-credit’
transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="boosting-the-horizontal-use-of-earned-credits">
<h2>Boosting the ‘horizontal’ use of earned credits</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Co-production programmes for credit-holders</li>
</ol>
<p>NALC and some other organisations have created or enhanced
co-production programmes directed at currently
active credit-holder members, such as adult education and
seminar series (A.S. interview, 14.7.2011). Acknowledging
such benefits, some local authorities provide small subsidies
and/or in-kind support - venues, learning resources
and printing expenses - to sustain and develop these. Such
programmes have made very positive impacts on healthy
participants, enhancing their social exchange and connections
as well as keeping them motivated and active in volunteering
(I.T. interview, 14.7.2011). Yet some programmes
have become like recreational or ‘get-together’ or
‘chatting’ groups among healthy members only, diverting
from the aim of Fureai Kippu - providing care and support
for needy people in society (S.E. interview, 14.7.2011).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Donations into a central pot</li>
</ol>
<p>Partly in response to the latter issue, NALC and a number
of bodies have extended credits transactions beyond families
to a wider population - all members lacking credits but
particularly those most needy - through donations into a
central pot, seen also in Royston Time Bank in Hertfordshire,
England (Swift, 2011:12 <a class="citation-reference" href="#swift2011" id="citation-reference-87">[Swift2011]</a>). This is significant, given
that considerable numbers of frail older people struggle
financially and hence are unable to afford even modest user
fees. Not surprisingly service users who buy services with
donated credits express a great appreciation (F.T. interview,
14.7.2011). Yet its expansion has been slow mainly
due to two reasons: the lack of volunteer members to meet
new demand and the shortage of donated credits because
many healthy credit-holders prefer to keep their credits for
future care of themselves or their relatives, reflecting their
strong motive for joining and volunteering, seemingly contradicting
their equally powerful motive for helping others
in need (K.N. interview, 8.12.2010). This highlights the
complexity and ambiguity surrounding volunteering with
time credit rewards, a theme discussed below.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Exchanges for local services</li>
</ol>
<p>Along with some other organisations, NALC enables credits
to be exchanged for admission to public facilities, such as
swimming pools and museums, or for reduced-price services
with local businesses, an application seen also in Spice
Time Bank in Wales (Naughton-Doe, 2011). Despite promotion,
very few NALC members use their credits in this way,
however. According to one senior member, this is ‘because
the motives of members are to help others and accumulate
credits for the future care of themselves or their family’
(NALC, 29.12.2010). A contrasting experience is seen ina
non-profit Fureai Kippu operating organisation in Shizuoka
Prefecture, helped by the Sawayaka Welfare Foundation.
Its main activity is providing day care services for isolated,
frail older people in a local authority-subsidised day centre
property. Here, while active members earn credits through,
for example, giving lifts, cooking lunch or engaging with
elderly members, they often simultaneously redeem their
credits to buy their own lunch or a shared lift back home by
another member (YI. interview, 3.12.2010). This has
proved very successful and membership has been growing
in recent years, its success partly attributable to the horizontal
use of earned credits and the subsidised day centre.
Yet, almost all day care participants lack credits and therefore
continue to pay the services in cash through tickets
(Y.L. interview, 3.12.2010).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Exchanges for cash vouchers</li>
</ol>
<p>Still others enable credits to be exchanged for cash vouchers.
For example, a one-hour credit with Helping Hands
near Tokyo, established in 2007 by the Miyanokawa Retail
Association in collaboration with local government, can be
exchanged for a £4 voucher, to be used in Association-registered
shops. According to the Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare Report, the scheme has contributed to
co-production and community building, seemingly embracing
the government’s ‘New Community’ vision; its 111 volunteers
in 2010 provided 1,200 hours’ support, with 453
participating shops (Cabinet Office, 2010 <a class="citation-reference" href="#cabinet2010" id="citation-reference-88">[Cabinet2010]</a>). Similarly, from
2007 local authorities offered public subsidies to develop
the ‘Care support volunteering’ system. Under the system,
the registered healthy older members earn credits for the
hours they volunteer, mainly assisting local frail older people
in domestic and residential settings. These credits can
then be used to pay for their own monthly LTCI insurance
premiums, based on their own convertibility rules. This
proved very popular, the number of participating authorities
reaching forty by 2011 (Cabinet Office, 2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#cabinet2010" id="citation-reference-89">[Cabinet2010]</a>). Taking
one example, the scheme run by the cosmopolitan Yokohama
City near Tokyo, started in 2009, attracted 4,000
registered volunteers within less than a year (Cabinet Office,
2011). Its success is again partly attributable to the
horizontal use of earned credits and local authority financial
support and initiatives. The latter echoes the 1990s
expansion in Fureai Kippu schemes, run by quasi-government
bodies with strong government promotion
and sound public funding. Typically the system does not
involve user fees, met by public subsidies. On balance this
highlights the stark difference of targeted volunteers, i.e.
the healthy ‘young’ old now and middle-aged housewives
in the 1990s.</p>
<!-- p.40 -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="enhancing-credit-to-credit-transactions">
<h2>Enhancing ‘credit-to-credit’ transactions</h2>
<p>“Long-distance care’</p>
<p>One significant and attractive feature of Fureai Kippu in
world time banks is credit transfers beyond localities, from
adult children (volunteer members) to their parents living
elsewhere (user members), so-called ‘Long-distance care’.
This has become increasingly pertinent, as living patterns
change, globalisation proceeds, and ‘traditional’ family care
declines. NALC has expanded opportunities for this arrangement
by developing new local branches nationwide
and international partner organisations in Zurich in 2002,
Los Angeles in 2005 and another under preparation in a
London non-profit organisation, with 200-plus predominantly
Japanese members (NALC, 29.4.2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nalc2011" id="citation-reference-90">[NALC2011]</a>). Yet such arrangements
remain insignificant at practical levels, accounting
for just 0.2% or 520 hours/credits of the total
service hours in 2010 (Figure 1). During the past five years,
only five care-dependent members in Japan paid services
with credits which were earned by their adult children in
Los Angeles (NALC, 29.4.2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nalc2011" id="citation-reference-91">[NALC2011]</a>). A similar situation is recorded
in Zurich: just three Zurich members currently
transfer their earned credits to their parents in Japan, although
the membership is fairly small, 120 members in Los
Angeles and 80 in Zurich (M.K. interview, 12.6.2012; NALC,
29.4.2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nalc2011" id="citation-reference-92">[NALC2011]</a>). Yet, positive impacts are expressed by those
involved and ‘long-distance care’ remains a distinctive and
key attraction for volunteer recruitment and existing
members alike (K.S. interview, 12.6.2012).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>‘Person-to-person’ model</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile attempts have also been made to expand traditional
person-to-person services based upon credit exchanges,
providing earning opportunities for frail older
members. Some care-dependent members can earn credits,
for example, by providing telephone calls to older people
living alone or for befriending the lonely and isolated (Y.I.
interview, 3.12.2010), as seen also in Member-to-Member
Time Bank in New York, funded by the insurance company
Elderplan (Christian, 2001 <a class="citation-reference" href="#christian2001" id="citation-reference-93">[Christian2001]</a>). This has attracted considerable
media coverage, but actually involves very small numbers
of people (L.F. interview, 8.12.2011). This in turn highlights
difficulties in and limitations of applying this model
to the area of care for frail or disabled older people.</p>
<p>In response, some Fureai Kippu schemes have sought out
younger participants and encouraged the exchange of credits
between generations; for example with older people
looking after toddlers and receiving home help from their
mothers in return, useful given the lack of child minding
and growing numbers of women at work. Indeed some
schemes have re-orientated on child care recently and
proved successful with increases in membership. Included
are the NALC international partner in Zurich and the VLB
Nara branch, both focusing upon young mothers and babysitting
(M.K. interview, 12.6.2012; Miller, 2008b <a class="citation-reference" href="#miller2008b" id="citation-reference-94">[Miller2008b]</a>). According
to Zurich leader members, despite attempts also to
promote intergenerational exchanges to address the key
aim of providing social care for older people in need, such
exchanges are rare since young members often prefer
baby-sitting to assisting with frail older people, while elderly
members are generally too frail or disabled to provide
child care (M.K. interview, 12.6.2012). Consequently such
elderly members continue to pay user fees for the services.
With more older people in residential settings, a few
schemes/branches now focus here, providing group activities,
befriending and outings. They often receive financial
and in-kind support from local government or residential
homes, alleviating participating residents from paying user
fees (C.A. interview, 8.12.2011). Yet since activities are
usually provided by active volunteers outside, caredependent
residents hardly earn credits.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issues-over-rewarding-time-credits-for-volunteering">
<h2>Issues over rewarding time credits for volunteering</h2>
<p>Did Fureai Kippu active members, rewarded with time
credits, really differ from traditional volunteers, with no
rewards? The Government, promoters and academics enthusiastically
endorsed the concept of rewards to attract
and retain a wider volunteer population (MoHW,
14.4.1993 <a class="citation-reference" href="#mohw1993" id="citation-reference-95">[MoHW1993]</a>; Tanaka, 1996 <a class="citation-reference" href="#tanaka1996" id="citation-reference-96">[Tanaka1996]</a>). However, the results were inconclusive:
according to a comprehensive 1993 survey, just
170 (13%) of 1,266 volunteers in mutual help groups, involving
monetary remuneration and/or time credits, cited
monetary rewards as a ‘primary’ motive and another 112
(9%) were preparing for their own future care needs by
earning credits, leaving the great majority acting from altruistic
motives (Kobayashi, 1994 <a class="citation-reference" href="#kobayashi1994" id="citation-reference-97">[Kobayashi1994]</a>). Similarly, active Fureai
Kippu members interviewed in the study stressed psychological
rewards, such as feelings of self-worth, fulfilment,
confidence and the gains of social networks, friendships
and greater understanding of the situation. Typically they
say: ‘I’d rather not use my credits at all and stay healthy to
continue volunteering. I do volunteering just because |
want to help others in need, exactly the same way as other
volunteers in different organisations do’(I.T. interview,
14.7.2011). Such accounts challenge widespread assumptions
and concerns expressed by some British voluntary
organisations: the reward element risks undermining traditional
forms and values of volunteering - the principle of
giving time for free (Quoted in BBC NEWS, 30.9.2010 <a class="citation-reference" href="#bbc2010" id="citation-reference-98">[BBC2010]</a>). Also,
the reward element may risk prioritising credit holders
rather than those in most need, though empirical evidence
is lacking.</p>
<!-- p.41 -->
<p>Yet motives vary and time credits can incentivise and provide
volunteers with a sense of security in old age. As one
83-year-old NALC member notes, ‘I started volunteering
sixteen years ago and have stored up over 10,000 time
credits. I don’t want to use my credits at all until I die but,
as I live alone and don’t have any relatives nearby, my
earned credits give me peace of mind: if anything happens
to me, I can get support and care with my credits’(C.A. interview,
8.12.2010). Another long-term senior active member
explains: ‘This sense of security is becoming increasingly
appreciated by our volunteers [members] who worry
over economic uncertainty and cutbacks of public welfare
provision’ (T.K. interview, 8.12.2010). As discussed, this
‘rewarding’ element also represents a key consideration in
volunteer recruitment, attracting different or new potential
volunteer populations, including those who are willing but
want something back. Nonetheless reasonably well-off
volunteers with supportive families also give all or part of
their credits to help others who lack them, though such
cases are the minority, as noted above. With different and
mixed motives, Fureai Kippu may not suit everyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="challenges">
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>One of the most pressing challenges confronting many
Fureai Kippu organisations is that care-dependent members
substantially outnumber active members (K.T. interview,
17.3.2012). This is due to the failure of volunteer
recruitment to keep pace with the growing numbers of
care-dependent members. Accordingly recent years witnessed
a shift in recruitment focus from overwhelmingly
middle-aged housewives towards the healthy ‘young old’,
including the post-war ‘baby boomers’ born during 1945-8
- totalling over eight million - of both sexes, whether working
or retired. Yet this has not proved entirely successful;
for example, in 2010 NALC experienced a decrease in
membership, the first since its establishment in 1994
(NALC, 15.7.2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nalc2011" id="citation-reference-99">[NALC2011]</a>). According to a NALC executive member,
this reflects the fact that the targeted healthy ‘young old’
volunteers are hit by government policy, specifically the
increase in retirement age and pensionable age, thus often
being compelled to choose continuing employment over
opting for voluntary work (NALC, 29.12.2010 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nalc2010" id="citation-reference-100">[NALC2010]</a>). This underscores
the increasing difficulty in recruiting the next generation
of leaders from whom even more will be expected
(1G. interview, 14.7.2011). Moreover, new recruits may not
produce a net gain as they may enter co-production programmes
between themselves rather than helping frail
elderly members, as discussed. In the wider context of care
provision it is important to remember that Fureai Kippu
has always made a much smaller contribution to care than
the state and family. For example, the 95 estimated Fureai
Kippu organisations actually in operation are greatly overshadowed
by the number of LTCI statutory care providers
(e.g. 34,000 home-based care organisations and 30,000 day
centre providers) (MoHLW, 2009 <a class="citation-reference" href="#mohlw2009" id="citation-reference-101">[MoHLW2009]</a>).</p>
<p>Equally important is the fact that Fureai Kippu’s expansion
and coordination may require public subventions and encouragement,
even though at lower levels than usual with
statutory care provision. As seen, the 1990s expansion of
Fureai Kippu schemes was closely connected to strong
government promotion and public funding, incorporating a
vision of public participant-style welfare, a policy focus on
volunteering, particularly in the area of care for older people,
and acknowledgement of ‘volunteering with rewards’.
This always left the potential for Fureai Kippu to become
over-dependant on public initiatives and money. In fact
public retrenchment after 2000 might have led to scaling
down of Fureai Kippu schemes run by government or
quasi-government bodies. Similarly, NALC which has chosen
not to seek public funding since its establishment in
1994 has recently struggled and now acknowledges the
need for public funding even if only modest (K.T. interview,
8.12.2010). Yet it could be argued that potentially enormous
demand could - as the LTCI state system has found -
overwhelm the Fureai Kippu system.</p>
<p>A further challenge revolves around the role of user fees. In
one NALC branch, for instance, user fees comprise 70% of
the total income, suggesting arrangements highly cost-effective
from the state’s point of view and sustainable
from the organisation’s point of view (NALC X branch,
10.7.2011 <a class="citation-reference" href="#nalc2011" id="citation-reference-102">[NALC2011]</a>). However, user fees are a potential deterrent to
many of those most needy and unable to pay the fees (I.G.
interview, 14.7.2011). The use of user fees also poses questions
about whether it is fundamentally consistent with the
conventional understanding of time-banking based only on
exchanges of time credits.</p>
<p>Finally, although recent efforts and attempts have gone a
long way to address the problems of limited ‘horizontal’
use of earned credits and ‘credit-to-credit’ transactions, no
all-embracing solution to these problems is likely to be
produced, reflecting the increasingly diverse needs, values
and expectations of all those groups of people showing an
interest or currently involved as users or volunteers. Rewarding
members in the context of mutualism also raises
complicated considerations. All of this confirms the complexity
and demanding nature of time-banking as applied
to providing care for frail older people. This in turn raises
questions about the applicability of time-banking in this
area.</p>

<h1>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</h1>
<p>This article has revealed that Japan’s Fureai Kippu is more
complex than simplistic and optimistic depictions usually
suggest. Japan’s near-40-year experience has demonstrated
that Fureai Kippu has always been closely linked and responsive
to specific and changing Japanese conditions,
highlighting its significance, on-going transformation, contributions
and persistent problems. Thus Japan’s Fureai
Kippu models cannot simply be replicated elsewhere;
nonetheless its experience is useful and relevant as an exemplar
of valuable precedents, with its world pioneering
role and large scale. This concluding section assesses
Fureai Kippu’s applicability to care for frail older people
and its role in the ‘Big Society’ with an ageing society.
The vast majority of Fureai Kippu schemes have operated
under reciprocal exchanges between members through
time credits and conventional money (user fees and sometimes
monetary ‘token’ remuneration). This is because the
activities involved are centred on providing domiciliary
care for frail older members who often themselves lack
credits due to their frailty or disability and therefore pay in
cash instead of credits. This suggests limitations and deficiencies
of Fureai Kippu in relation to ‘model’ time-banking
based upon ‘credit-to-credit’ exchanges. Yet this is the very
model which expanded considerably in the 1990s and still
remains dominant, suggesting this might be the best model
in this area and casting doubt on the currently conventional
time-banking evaluations based upon ‘credit-to-credit’
frameworks.</p>
<p>Given the pressing demand for social care for growing ageing
populations and continued funding constraints, the
British and Japanese governments have acknowledged that
funding and delivery of care must change. In this context,
both governments have highlighted social participation
elements in the shared vision of the ‘Big Society’. In Fureai
Kippu, care delivery is based on mutualism and reciprocity
and so is cost-effective. This is therefore one possible way
to supplement relatively expensive statutory care provision.
However, as already apparent, Fureai Kippu is not a
universal panacea, but should be seen as a valuable and
necessary adjunct to other forms of care. A possible best-case
scenario could involve a multi-pronged approach
combining adequate, high quality statutory care, supplemented
by various voluntary and mutual efforts, including
Fureai Kippu, which can meet the volume and range of less-specialised
care requirements with a human touch, with
the remainder addressed by informal care networks of
family, friends and close neighbours. But how to pursue
this objective under increasing pressures remains a challenge
for Japan and Britain alike. In particular, neither
shows signs of allocating adequate funding towards organisations
that are willing to take on care responsibilities. Yet
this may be crucial to securing the future of Fureai Kippu,
and strengthening its contribution to the ‘Big Society’ and
so resolving a Key problem at the heart of the ageing society.</p>
